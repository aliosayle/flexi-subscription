# Server Code Refactoring Guide

## Overview

This refactoring project breaks down the monolithic `server.js` file into a more modular and maintainable structure. The goals of this refactoring are:

1. Improve code organization and readability
2. Make the codebase easier to maintain
3. Support better separation of concerns
4. Make it easier to add new features

## Directory Structure

The new structure organizes the code as follows:

```
server/
├── config/             # Configuration files
│   ├── db.js           # Database configuration
│   └── constants.js    # Application constants
├── middleware/         # Middleware functions
│   ├── auth.js         # Authentication middleware
│   └── validation.js   # Request validation middleware
├── routes/             # API routes organized by resource
│   ├── auth.js         # Authentication routes
│   ├── inventory.js    # Inventory management routes
│   ├── sales.js        # POS/Sales routes
│   └── ... (more to come)
├── utils/              # Utility functions
│   └── helpers.js      # Helper functions for error formatting, etc.
└── server.js           # Main application entry point
```

## Migration Steps

To complete the refactoring, you'll need to continue migrating the remaining routes from the monolithic `server.js` file. Here's how:

1. Create new route files in the `routes/` directory for each major feature:
   - `companies.js`
   - `branches.js`
   - `users.js`
   - `dashboard.js`
   - `packages.js`
   - `subscribers.js`

2. Move the related routes from `server.js` to these files

3. Update the `server.js.new` file to import and use these route modules

4. Once all routes are migrated, rename `server.js.new` to `server.js`

## Testing

After refactoring, thoroughly test all routes to ensure they work exactly as before. The functionality should remain unchanged.

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Each file has a clear, single responsibility
- **Readability**: Smaller files are easier to read and understand
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without bloating the main file
- **Testability**: Modular code is easier to test in isolation

## Additional Notes

The refactored code maintains backward compatibility with existing API clients by preserving the same route patterns. We've also added support for dual URL patterns where needed for smooth transition.

The error handling has been standardized across the application using the helpers in `utils/helpers.js`.
